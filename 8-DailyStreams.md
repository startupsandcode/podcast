# Episode 8 - Daily Streams

I'm going to try a new thing.

I want to do daily streams on youtube.

Nothing crazy, just a 5-10 minute stream every day.

I'm going to talk about what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and what I'm thinking about.

I'm going to do this for one reason:
1. I want to get better at being consistent.

I'm going to start this today. Already did it actually.

I didn't talk at all, but I did a stream.  Tomorrow may be different.

Let's see how this experiment goes.


By the time you see this, I've done about 5 streams.  I'm going to keep doing them for a while and see how it goes.
