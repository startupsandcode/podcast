# Episode 9 - Preparation and Communication

Welcome to Episode 9 of Startups and Code. Today, I'm going to talk about preparation and communication.

Preparation is critical to success and even more important when you're working with a team.  It's important to have a plan and to communicate that plan to your team.

In this episode, I talk about OBS and live streaming.  I had so many issues with OBS and I've learned so much in just a week.

Things I discuss in this episode:

* OBS, Audio, Lighting, and Videos

* Lua Script for Zoom: [Zoom To Mouse](https://github.com/BlankSourceCode/obs-zoom-to-mouse)

* Stacking scenes in OBS

* Communication with Teams
