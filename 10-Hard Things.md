# Episode 10 - Hard Things

Welcome to Episode 10 of Startups and Code. 

Today, I'm going a little off script and talk about some hard things. I'm doing a daily build of some basic web development and having a lot of fun doing. I am building on Next.js and really enjoying it.
That's just a plug for my daily, which isn't daily and that consistency is what is so hard.

However, today I'm not going into the code side of things, but the life side of things. Team dynamics, building a product vs building a company, and the hard things that come with it.

Things I discuss in this episode:

* Product vs Company

* Team Dynamics

* Life vs Work vs Family vs Friends vs Health
